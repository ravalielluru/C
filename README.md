# PAYPAL Code Submission:

This archive contains a simple credit card processing application. It has two components: a Ruby web and application server beelzebub (using the Sinatra framework, and running under Unicorn), and a requester which simulates making requests against the server. The server receives the requests and writes them to its data directory. The server also logs each transactionâ€™s start time and completion time via syslog.
